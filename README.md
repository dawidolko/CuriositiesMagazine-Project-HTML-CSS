# 1. Title Page

Project title: Model Internet Service – Responsive HTML/CSS Page

The project includes a set of web pages consisting of various sections such as home, gallery, products, services, contact, FAQ, and privacy policy, each defined using HTML and styled with dedicated CSS files. The pages are designed with the aim of providing the user with an intuitive and engaging experience, facilitating easy navigation and access to necessary information.

**File details:**

- `ourProducts.html`, `pay.html`, `productFirst.html`, `productSecond.html`, `productThird.html`: These pages describe the offered products, allow users to familiarize themselves with the offer and make purchases. Their styling is defined in CSS files corresponding to the product names.
- `services.html`, `privacy.html`, `aboutUs.html`, `contact.html`, `faq.html`, `gallery.html`, `home.html`: Each of these pages serves a specific purpose, from presenting services, informing about privacy policy, to providing contact with the service owners. These pages are designed in a way that allows the user to easily find the necessary information.
- **CSS Files:** For each HTML page, a corresponding CSS file has been prepared that is responsible for the visual presentation of the content. Each of these files contains selectors and style rules specific to the page elements, regulating aspects such as layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.

# 3. Proposed Solution to the Problem

Based on the analysis of provided HTML/CSS codes, such as home.html, faq.html, productFirst.html, and others, here are the proposed methods for solving the problem of creating a universal and effective website template for a student project.

## 1. Code Structure and Organization:

**Goal:** Facilitate template management and development.

**Solution:** Use semantic HTML and modular CSS, where each page (e.g., home, faq, product) is built from repeatedly used components. This will simplify later modifications and code maintenance, as well as allow for easy template personalization.

**Example:** In home.html, use headers, sections, and articles from semantic HTML to structure content; in faq.html, use lists for questions and answers.

## 2. Responsiveness and Appearance:

**Goal:** Ensure attractive and functional display on all devices.

**Solution:** Use responsive techniques, such as media queries in CSS, flexbox, and grid, to make the template adjust to different screen sizes. Styling and layout of each page (home, faq, product) should automatically adapt to the device context.

**Example:** In CSS for each page, apply media rules for popular breakpoints, such as tablets and smartphones.

## 3. Interactivity and Usability:

**Goal:** Enhance user experience through interactive and intuitive elements.

**Solution:** Add interactive elements like dropdown menus, carousels, or accordions, especially in areas where users may expect more interactivity (e.g., product section, FAQ). This will facilitate navigation and make the page more engaging.

**Example:** In products, the ability to browse product photos using a slider; in FAQ, use accordions for displaying and hiding answers.

## Implementation:

1. **Code Structure and Organization:**

   - The code will be organized around clearly defined components and sections.
   - Each HTML page and CSS file will have consistent and thoughtful class and ID naming, facilitating code navigation.

2. **Responsiveness and Appearance:**

   - Each page element will be designed with flexibility in mind to adapt to different screen resolutions.
   - Styling will utilize modern CSS techniques, including CSS variables, for easy theme color or font changes.

3. **Interactivity and Usability:**
   - JS scripts will be added for additional interactivity where needed, considering simplicity and efficiency.
   - Accessibility and ease of use will be ensured for every interactive element, also for users utilizing screen readers or keyboards.

## Summary:

Solving the problem of creating a universal website template for a student project requires the use of clean, modular code, responsive design techniques, and adding interactive elements that increase user engagement. The adopted approach aims to ensure that the template is easy to adapt and develop, regardless of the specific needs of the project it will be used for.

The homepage looks good in the desktop version, with no bends or protruding edges. The navigation bar looks clear, is described, and additionally acts on the imagination through icons.

![project](img/description/photo29.png)

The gallery and detail section in the desktop version are relatively clear, with equal spacing from the edges and equal spacing between photos. Everything looks legible and does not cause problems with reading.

![project](img/description/photo30.png)

The slider and product sections have equal indentations and good placement, are fully legible, and meet the requirements regarding assumptions.

![project](img/description/photo31.png)
![project](img/description/photo32.png)

Elements are adjusted in such a way that they do not dazzle the eye and encourage clicking on a given product. Certainly, their number does not overwhelm and acts naturally on the imagination.

![project](img/description/photo33.png)
![project](img/description/photo34.png)

The page ends on the footer section, which in a minimalist way does not spoil the overall execution of the page and fully adapts to the chosen devices.

![project](img/description/photo35.png)

Subpages also have correct layout and are legible to the eye, realizing the vision of a comprehensive company.

![project](img/description/photo36.png)

Contact and payment forms are centrally placed in the middle of the screen, which is certainly pleasant for the eye and suitable for the user.

![project](img/description/photo37.png)
![project](img/description/photo38.png)

Products and their descriptions are matched to each other, showing that they fit together and do not spoil the vision of connecting the whole.

## Mobile Format Page Tests:

![project](img/description/photo39.png)

The navigation bar looks good, the cart icon is separately highlighted to stand out from the entire set of tabs. The logo is constantly placed in the corner of the screen to be embedded in memory. It stands out and does not overlap with other elements.

![project](img/description/photo40.png)

![project](img/description/photo41.png)

As you can see, the photos have changed their position and are still at equal distances from each other, fulfilling the vision of a responsive page.

![project](img/description/photo42.png)

The slider is now ready for scrolling slide by slide, through which one can still view the products presented in it in a legible way.

![project](img/description/photo43.png)

Promotions, newsletters, and the footer bar have also arranged themselves in a legible and responsive way. This shows that the page is fully responsive and well-adapted.

![project](img/description/photo44.png)

Subpages, as you can see, are also fully responsive and meet the project's assumptions. The distances are equal, making the page good for the eye and attracting customers. The navigation bar does not cover too much field and fulfills the touch area requirement (40px x 40px).

![project](img/description/photo45.png)

Contact and payment forms are perfectly adapted to mobile devices, are legible, and meet the conditions of a responsive page.

In summary, it can be observed that the page in both mobile and desktop versions is made in a good way. There are no indentations, cutting edges, or scroll bars anywhere. The page meets the assumptions and has been fully tested responsively. Below are supplementary tests such as validation results or page loading speed tests.

# 5. Code Comments and KSS Documentation

The code is commented in such a way as to provide clear and legible information about each section of the code. Comments are used to describe what each block of code does and what its main goals and functions are. This helps programmers understand the structure and operation of the code and facilitates maintenance and possible modifications in the future.

Comments are also used to fulfill this point requirement:

- Comments are used to describe root variables, keyframes, and styles for the body of the page, header, and other sections of the code.
- Comments are written in a clear and understandable way, which helps other programmers quickly understand the code.
- Comments include information on what a given code fragment does, what its visual effects are, and what techniques (e.g., flexbox) are used in the project.

Thanks to this approach, the code is readable and easy to manage, and programmers can easily work on the project and implement any changes or improvements.

All images used in the project were generated using the artificial intelligence model DALL-E. I am unable to provide direct links to the sources, as these images are the result of the DALL-E model's generation process, rather than coming from specific external sources.

In the part of the documentation dedicated to source code, particular attention was paid to the detailed documentation of the most important CSS functions. The documentation was prepared using the KSS (Knyle Style Sheets) methodology, which allowed for the creation of readable, consistent, and easily accessible documentation for all team members. This methodology enables both the description of styles directly in the code and the automatic generation of style guides, significantly facilitating the management of CSS code and

its subsequent maintenance.

Documentation KSS for the most important CSS functions includes not only the selectors and properties themselves but also their application, possible modifications, and examples of use, greatly facilitating the understanding and use of the code by other developers.

Thanks to this approach, the source code of the project is not only well-organized but also transparent and adapted for cooperation and continuous development.

Example images showing the KSS documentation (Knyle Style Sheets):

# 6. Links to Sources

As for the icons used in navigation, they were obtained from the [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) service.

Graphic contents and icons from Flaticon are available under the Creative Commons BY 3.0 license, meaning they can be used in projects, provided the author is credited (attribution). Therefore, the project author should include appropriate attributions for these icons, informing about their source and author.
